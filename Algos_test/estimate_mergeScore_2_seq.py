usage: ./estimate_mergeScore_2_seq.py <file.fasta>
This script is used to test algorithms to give an estimate percent score
between 2 sequences. 
It wil compare each pair of a set of sequences (given by a fasta file)
The main goal is to find a suitable algorithm for a GPU
usage. Therefore, a fairly precise algorithm is required (the reverse
complement is not an obligation as we can re-calculate it),
using as little memory as possible (the computation time is less important).
The ideal algorithm would not care if the beginning of the first read and the
ending of the second one are not merged with the other read if a lot of the
reads are merged, example :
 -read1: CCCGATTCA
 -merge:  ||||| ||
 -read2:  CCGATCCAAT
 -score: high percent

Algorithm 'Needleman&Wunsch'
Based on an needleman principe: each case is the best of
 - score[i-1][j-1] + (seq1[i]==seq2[j]?1:-1) #Match / mismatch
 - score[i-1][j]-1 #Indel
 - score[i][j-1] #Indel
The first nuc of seq2 is either a match of score 1 or a mismatch of score -1: the gap before this on the seq1 doesn't count.
After the end seq1, indels on seq2 doesn't count.
The best score is the best of the last score line and the last column

Algorithm 'Needle3Arrays
Same algorithm but using a score matrix of size (seq1.size(),2)
as we only need the previous line to calculate the current one.
'''
			


'''
Algorithm 'dot_cut'.
The principe is to increase the score when the merge is contiguous (diagonal
comparaison) but an difference make a score=0 :
	IF seq1[i] == seq2[j]: score_actual[j] = score_previous[j-1]+1
	ELSE: score_actual[j] = 0
	...do stuff...
	score_previous = score_actual

Then the final percent score is the sum of higher scores before a difference
compared to a perfect match.
This way you have only to memorize 2 'comparaison' column score and the best
scores.
When a part of seq2 has been 'scored', only check the remaining (on the right)
of seq2 to avoid to count a same parts multiple times and to do "come-backs".
